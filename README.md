# Unboxed Training Course

Ruby and Rails training course for Unboxed Consulting interns.

## Context

Chris, Leo, Murray and Claire are the core stakeholders in the intern programme this year, but we encourage everyone in the company to contribute. We'd like this to be something that is maintained and of such a quality that it can be delivered to paying customers.

## Course Structure

The sections below outline the course structure. Each section has its own directory in this repository.

### 1. Ruby

We begin the training programme by teaching core Ruby.

### 2. ActiveRecord

After Ruby, we move onto ActiveRecord, decoupled from a Rails application.

### 3. Rack

After ActiveRecord, we begin looking at web applications through Rack and Sinatra.

This will be a simple representation of how it all works. The intention is to motivate the move to Rails.

### 4. Rails

After teaching Rack applications, we move onto Rails.

### 5. You've built an app... What next?

* Deployment
  * Capistrano
  * Amazon Web Services
* Code review(s)
* Continuous Integration

#### Things to remember

* Differences between Rails 2 and 3
* Refactoring
