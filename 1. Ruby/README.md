# Ruby

We begin the training programme by teaching core Ruby.

## Preliminary Content

* Git with text files
* Committing and experimenting with change
* Set context (history) - very brief
* Syntax
* IRB
* Features
* Object model (spend quite some time on this)
* Strings
* Arrays
* Hashes
* Control flow
* Blocks
* Classes
* Regular expressions (simple)

## Things to remember

* Lots of practice / breaks
* Build on current day two slides (idisk.unboxedconsulting.com/Unboxed_Consulting/Presentations/Rails Course/v2/Day 2)
* Test-first development (need to know about writing tests at the end of the Ruby section)
