# 2011 Retrospective Feedback

Feedback from the Ruby on Rails course that was delivered in 2011

* Love testing
* Practise RSpec
* Dev cycle of simple app from start to finish (concepts and theories along the way)
* Easiest to learn by doing
* More doing less listening
* Practicals most productive
* More practical time
* Too much in too little time
* Exercise on day four felt hard
* Days one to three were the best
* Move examples before exercises (e.g. how RoR does forms/html before doing own)
* Theory is important
* Good materials
* Questions answered well

## Actions

* Perhaps we should not teach so many things so fast—focus on a few and make sure students understand them.
* Give students more realistic problems and applications that would make them learn better.
* Make the examples used more familiar with ones that the students will have come across/ will come across
* Do more examples in the class—learn by doing examples
